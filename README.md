# WebCrawler Clean Code
 Assignment 1 from Clean Code --> Simple web crawler

v1 -->  We created simple web crawler that crawls to a specific depth and gives us links of crawled web pages!
        First method crawl is successfully tested, and I got Maven working.
        
v2 --> Added another method that gives us a String array with all specific headings (h1,h2,h3..) that you pick and outputs it to the console and saves it to the array!
